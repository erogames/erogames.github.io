One of the members of Breast Friends is My Breast Friend Sally. In this blog post, we are going to talk about Sally and her experience with breast cancer.

Sally was diagnosed with stage 1b breast cancer in January of this year. After a few weeks of radiation therapy and hysterectomy, she is doing well and feeling positive about her future. Although this was a difficult experience for Sally, she is using it as an opportunity to raise awareness for other women who are dealing with this disease.

We want to empower our readers by sharing Sally's story, so please feel free to share it on your social media platforms if you think it could help someone else!

## Who Is Sally?

## What Does Sally Do?
Sally is a breast friend. She helps women feel comfortable and confident about their breasts. Sally provides support, education, and encouragement to all of her breast friends.

## How Did I Meet Sally?

I first met Sally when I was out walking my dog. She was flying around in the sky and I thought she was so beautiful. I started to follow her and eventually we ended up meeting each other. We talked for a while and I learned that she is a butterfly!

## Why Is Sally My Best Friend?

Sally is my best friend because she understands me and my needs. She is always there for me when I need her, no matter what. We share a lot of common interests, and we can talk about anything. Sally is the perfect person to have as a friend, and I would be lost without her.

## What Have We Done Together?

We have written about a variety of topics together including safety around the fire pit and how butterflies eat. Today we will be discussing something that we have all probably done at one time or another- playing outside! Playing outside is an important part of childhood and it helps to develop social skills. It also allows us to get exercise and explore our environment. However, playing outside can also be dangerous if not done correctly. Here are some tips for staying safe while playing outside:

1) Always be aware of your surroundings. If you see something suspicious, don't go near it or touch it. Report what you see to a parent or guardian immediately.
2) Avoid playing in areas that are dark or dangerous. These areas could contain hazardous materials that you do not know about or dangerous animals that you might encounter.
3) Stay away from busy streets and parking lots. These areas are often congested and full of cars which could make it difficult for you to escape if something happens.
4) Never play alone unless you are sure that your parents or guardians are nearby in case of an emergency.
5) Wear appropriate clothing when playing outside. This includes shoes that fit well and clothing that will protect you from the sun, rain, wind and snow. Remember to bring a hat as well!
6) Play safely by following the rules of the playground or park where you are playing. For example, stay on the designated paths, do not run into other children, obey posted signs and never climb trees or poles without adult supervision.
7) If you become lost, stop walking and orient yourself using the sun, stars and any nearby landmarks before trying to find your way back home. If there is no way to return home safely, seek help from a parent or guardian or contact a local emergency number such as 911.

## What Are Some Of Our Inside Jokes?

There are many inside jokes that we share among friends. Some of our favorites include making fun of people's names, mocking the way someone speaks, and making fun of the way someone looks. These jokes are usually shared between close friends who know each other well, but they can also be enjoyed by outsiders who happen to be in on the joke.

Some people might think that these jokes are mean-spirited or disrespectful, but in reality they're just funny. They help us connect with one another and make us feel comfortable around one another. It's interesting to note that some of our favorite jokes have been around for centuries, and they will continue to be popular long after we're gone.

## Conclusion

Sally is my best friend because she is always there for me. She knows how to make me laugh, knows when I need a shoulder to cry on, and always has time for me. We've been through a lot together, and I know I can always count on her. She's my breast friend, and I love her for it!
