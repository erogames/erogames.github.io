## What Is FreshWomen?

FreshWomen is a blog about being young and female. We want to provide our readers with information that will help them feel empowered, beautiful and confident. We want to show our readers that they can do anything that they set their mind to, no matter what their age or gender may be. We believe that everyone should be able to have fun and enjoy life, regardless of what other people may think.

In this blog post, we are going to be discussing the topic of safety. As young women, it is important for us to be aware of the dangers that exist around us. One of the most dangerous things that we can do is start fires. Not only is a fire dangerous in itself, but it also poses a risk to our health and safety.

When it comes to having a fire on the grass, you need to be very careful about how you go about doing it. You don't want your fire to get out of control, and you especially don't want to end up injuring yourself or someone else. There are a few precautions that you need to take into account when setting yourfirepitonthegrass: 

1) Make sure that your fire pit is located in an open area- preferably on concrete or pavers. This way, if there is any accidental sparking from the wood ashes, they will fall onto the ground rather than onto you or someone else. 
2) Make sure that your fire pit is elevated off of the ground so that it does not come in contact with any part of your body or clothing. If at all possible, try to purchase a fire pit that allows you to stand directly underneath of it so that if any sparks end up falling, they will land on the metal grill instead of you. 
3) Make sure that your materials are properly disposedofafteryouhaveusedtheminyourfirepit. Burning wood ash contains chemicals such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides which can be harmful if inhaled. Always use caution when disposing of materials around your fire pit and make sure to follow local regulations governing the burning of waste materials
