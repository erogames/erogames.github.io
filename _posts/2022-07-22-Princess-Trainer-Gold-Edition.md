## The Game
The Princess Trainer Gold Edition is a new game that was just released and it is available for download on the App Store and Google Play. The game is a simulation/quest type game where you play as one of the princesses who have been kidnapped by the dragon. In order to save the princess, you need to find items and solve puzzles to progress.

One of the new features in this edition is the fire pit. You can put a fire pit right in your backyard and enjoy some warm fireside chats with your friends. But be aware that this is not a safe activity and if done incorrectly, you could end up getting hurt or even worse, start a fire!

Here are some safety tips to keep in mind when having a fire pit: 
- Make sure your fire pit is elevated off of the ground so that sparks don't fall onto any part of your body or clothing
- Purchase a fire pit that has been elevated off of the ground so that it does not come in contact with any part of your body or clothing
- Make sure your fire pit is located in an open area- preferably on concrete or pavers
- Keep your fire pit away from trees so that ashes don't fall onto leaves and get into the grass
