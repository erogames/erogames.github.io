## 1. How To Prepare Your Home Before Leaving For A Trip
When you're planning on leaving your dog home alone for a short period of time, there are a few things you should do to make sure their stay is as safe and comfortable as possible.

1. Make sure your home is prepared - before you leave, make sure all the windows are closed and locked, all the screens are in place, and that there are no cords or other objects dangling around that could be dangerous if your dog were to get into them.
2. Keep your dog entertained - make sure to provide your dog with toys, treats, and fresh water throughout the day so they don't get bored or anxious. If you're able to take your dog outside, be sure to bring along plenty of fresh water and enough chew toys to keep them busy.
3. Create a safe space - if you have children in the house who might be excited to see you when you come home, it's important to create a space where they can't reach your dog or anything else in the house that could be dangerous. Put up gates or baby gates if necessary so that your pet can't escape and harm themselves or someone else in the process.
4. Be patient - while leaving your dog home alone may seem like the best option at the time, remember that they may become stressed out if left alone for too long. It might take some patience on your part to see how their mood changes over time- but eventually, you'll know when it's time to come home!
