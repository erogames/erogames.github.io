## What Is Lollipop Chainsaw?

Lollipop Chainsaw is an action-horror game developed by PlatinumGames and published by Sega for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. The game was first announced at Sony's press conference during the E3 2010 video game trade show, and was released worldwide on October 25, 2010.

The game is set within a colorful world of pop culture references, with the player controlling Juliet Starling, a teenage girl who has been cryogenically frozen for 100 years due to a genetic disease that causes her to spontaneously combust. When she is woken up from cryogenic suspension by Dr. Krieger and his assistant Amanda Young, they learn that the world has changed significantly since her departure: society is now run by machines, people have become sterile and obese as a result of over-consumption of foodstuffs, and monsters called "Chainsaw Angels" roam the countryside indiscriminately slaughtering anyone in their way.

To combat these dangers, Juliet must use her powerful weapons - including a sawed-off shotgun, a rocket launcher, and a chainsaw - to take down the angels using quick reflexes and strategic planning. Throughout the course of the game, players will encounter different characters who can help them in their fight against the angels; these allies include old friends such as Maxine Zandonella from "Max Payne", new characters such as Balthazar Blake from "Bayonetta", and even classic horror movie monsters such as Frankenstein's monster.

## Conclusion

Lollipop Chainsaw is a fun and fast-paced game that will keep you entertained for hours. The main character, Juliet, is a lovable and badass high schooler who kicks serious zombie butt. The gameplay is straightforward and easy to pick up, but the boss battles are challenging and require some strategy. The game ends with a bang, but there is plenty of postgame content to keep you coming back for more.
