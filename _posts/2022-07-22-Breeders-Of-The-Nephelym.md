## What Is The Nephelym?
The Nephelym is a term that has been used to describe a variety of different species of butterflies. The Nephelym includes both the monarch butterfly and the viceroy butterfly. These two species are considered to be the most important butterflies in terms of population numbers. The monarch butterfly is known for its annual migration from North America to Mexico, and then back again. The viceroy butterfly travels from South America to Central America, and then back again.

## Where Do They Come From?
Butterflies come from all over the world. They can be found in most climates and habitats, including forests, grasslands, deserts and even urban areas. There are about 1,500 different species of butterflies and they vary in size, color and shape.

Butterflies go into a state of dormancy during the winter. This means that they stop flying and spending energy. Some butterflies will even migrate long distances to find warmer climates.

## What Do They Look Like?

Most butterflies have wings that are bright colors and decorated with intricate patterns. Some of the common butterfly species include the monarch, tortoise beetle, swallowtail, peacock and blue jay.

## How do they eat?

## What Are Their Powers?
Butterflies have many amazing powers, some of which include the ability to fly, see in the dark and hear better than humans. They are also known for their delicate beauty and unique markings.

## Are They Dangerous?

Yes, fire pits are very dangerous and if done incorrectly, you could end up hurting yourself or worse, start a fire. If you're thinking of having a fire pit on the grass, make sure to check with your local municipality to see if it's okay. In general, you should avoid putting your fire pit on dirt because when the wood ashes fall onto the ground, that's where they will stay until they are washed away. You also want to be careful about how close the fire pit is to trees because if the embers fall onto any branches or leaves, that could easily start a fire. Finally, always make sure to buy a fire pit that features an elevated design so that it does not come in contact with your body or clothing.
