## Bobby Is A Naughty Little Boy Who Doesn't Listen To His Parents

Bobby is a naughty little boy who doesn't listen to his parents. He knows that they are mad at him, so he tries to hide from them. But Bobby is a smart boy, and he knows that there is one place where his parents can't find him- in the backyard!

When it's time for dinner, Bobby usually runs into the backyard and starts building a fire. His parents are always worried about fires in the backyard, so they tell Bobby not to build a fire. But Bobby doesn't listen. He knows that if he builds a fire, his parents will be angry with him.

So Bobby tries to hide from his parents when they are outside by building a fire in the backyard. But even though Bobby is clever, his bad behavior eventually catches up with him. One day, Bobby's father found him building a fire in the backyard and he was very angry!

If you want to avoid getting into trouble with your parents, don't try to hide from them. Instead, be honest and explain why you're doing something. If your parents are reasonable and understand what you're trying to do, they may not get angry with you. But if your parents are angry and don't understand why you're doing something, they may discipline you accordingly.
